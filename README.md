## David Millen

I am currently a student at the Makers Academy enrolled on the 12 week intensive 
developer bootcamp to become a full stack developer.  I moved into development 
so that I could learn different coding languages as a full stack developer.
I enjoy building programs from scratch and seeing the code come to life.

I worked in finance system administraton for various companies/charities between 
2016-2020.  Working in this area involved debugging finance system issues, 
training staff, dealing with user queries and general system admin.  
The problem solving and debugging skills I acquired when working in accountancy 
can be transferred to coding such as a systematic approach to problem solving 
and good communication.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
I gained this skill working in accountancy for many years where attention to 
detail was required to ensure accuracy of financial information.  For example
attention to detail was required at ETF when running month end reports for
budget holders.  This is transferrable to coding as you have to have a keen 
eye for detail when debugging lines of code.   

#### Creativity
I come from a humanities background as well as accountancy and I can bring 
creativity to problem solving, generating new ideas and coding more generally.  

#### Debugging / Problem solving

Debugging / problem solving was always required in each of my roles as a systems 
admin.  Often users would encounter an accounting issue or system error which 
had to be resolved so systemtic testing, research and sometimes working with 
third party support was often required.  For example at Statpro I was able to 
debug issues such as with the general ledger by querying the sql database 
using sql server.  Another example is during the UAT before the new finance 
system was deployed we would have to solve issues and debug any issues found 
during testing.  Resolving these issues enabled the deployment to be smoother as
issues were resolved beforehand

#### Communication
In all the systems accounting roles I have had good communication was always 
required so that any system issues, key information or warnings were clearly 
explained and any training given was understood.  For example I trained finance 
users at Statpro (for the new finance system deployment and ETF (for training 
non finance users to use the purchase order system).  
Good communication was vital in this role as project tasks, finance procedures 
and system processes had to be clearly explained to finance and non finance 
users.  This is transferable when pair programming or working in groups where 
communication is important.  

#### Documentation writing
I wrote the documentation for the finance system for non finance users at ETF
and at Statpro for the newly deployed finance system in 2019 using the internal
wiki.  The information contained within that document had to be clear and 
concise.  This experience can be transferred to when having to write clear 
README files for programs.
