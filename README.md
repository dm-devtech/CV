## David Millen

I am currently a student at the Makers Academy enrolled on the 12 week intensive
developer bootcamp course.  I moved into development so that I could learn front
and back end technologies.  I also enjoy building programs from scratch
and seeing the code come to life.

I worked in finance system administraton for various companies/charities between
2016-2020.  The problem solving and debugging skills I acquired when working in
systems administration can be transferred to coding such as a systematic
approach to problem solving and good communication.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
-  Attention to detail was required at ETF when running month end reports for
budget holders.  This is transferrable to coding as you have to have a keen
eye for detail when debugging lines of code.   

#### Creativity
- I come from a humanities background as well as accountancy and I can bring
creativity to problem solving, generating new ideas and coding more generally.  

#### Debugging / Problem solving
- At Statpro I was able to debug issues such as with the general ledger by
querying the sql database using sql server.  
- Also, during the UAT before the new finance system was deployed we would
- have to solve issues and debug any issues found
during testing.  

#### Communication
- Good communication was always required working in systems administration
so that any system issues, key information or warnings were clearly explained
and any training given was understood.  

#### Process Driven
- In all my roles as a systems admin writing and following procedures were
required for example writing the processes for budget holder reporting at
month end at ETF and also writing tax input procedures at Statpro.  

#### Documentation writing
- I wrote the documentation for the finance system for non finance users at ETF
and at Statpro for the newly deployed finance system in 2019 using the internal
wiki.
