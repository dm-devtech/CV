## Personal Profile

I previously worked in accounting (specialising in finance systems administration) for companies and organisations in the UK.  I moved into coding in 2020 because I am motivated by the opportunities coding gives to be creative and build apps that promote learning, provide a useful function or solve a real world problem.  I find it inspiring that coding knowledge gives you to convert any idea into a tangible app.  

I graduated from the Makers Academy coding course in December 2020 which focused on TDD, OOP, pair programming and group projects.  The course fundamentals were taught in Ruby and JavaScript.  During the course I undertook multiple external reviews of my coding process in Javascript so that I could improve my TDD process.  I have a strong passion for learning so every day I try to research topics and code in order to expand my knowledge and grow as a developer.  

I recently built a game to learn foreign language words (in German, French and Latin) and this included building dictionary APIs.  I have contributed to open source projects as I very much enjoy collaborating with other devs and I find making successful pull requests to open source projects very satisfying.  I have good attention to detail having worked in finance, good problem solving skills and interpersonal skills.  Before working in finance I worked in marketing so I have an understanding of the vital role of the customer, their feedback and the importance of the user journey.  In my spare time I enjoy writing music and travelling.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
- For example where Historical GL data was required for the deployment of a new finance system.  My task was to map the historical GL data to the new chart of accounts and upload the data for all entities prior to system deployment.  My action was to export historical GL data from the old finance system for prior years, to convert the coding of the data to the new chart of accounts and to convert the data into the correct template format for the upload, review data and ensure accuracy and then upload the data separately for each entity.  The result was that the data was uploaded for multiple entities in time for the deployment of the finance system.

#### Communication
- Good communication was always required working in systems administration for example when training.  An example of this was training requisitioners and approvers to use the purchase order system.  The task was to write the guidance documentation for the PO system and deliver training to budget holders and requisitioners.  My action was to deliver the training over multiple sessions, create the required Powerpoint slides, write the guidance documentation and ensure training examples were set up in the test system.  The result was that the guidance documentation was clear and ensured the users understood the company policies relating to purchase orders.  Positive feedback was received for the training and guidance documentation.  Users increased knowledge of the finance system and had recorded training as well as documentation to refer to.

#### Process Driven
- An example of this was the processing of finance systems helpdesk tickets.  The task was to ensure tickets were raised and processed correctly.  My action was to ensure that tickets were raised for finance systems issues, tickets had the relevant priority and detail, ensure that manager approval for the relevant tasks was received before actioning system changes such as opening and closing financial periods or creating GL codes.  The result was that the ticketing system was ewll maintained and system changes were made in accordance with procedure, ensuring a detailed audit trail for tickets so that analsis could take place based on helpdesk  reports.
