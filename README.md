## David Millen

Aspiring developer, looking for an entry level position. Excited to learn new technologies and focused on test driven
development. Graduated from the Makers intensive coding bootcamp in December 2020 

I worked in finance system administraton for various companies/charities between
2016-2020.  The problem solving and debugging skills I acquired when working in
systems administration can be transferred to coding such as a systematic
approach to problem solving and good communication.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
-  Attention to detail was required at ETF when running month end reports for
budget holders.  This is transferrable to coding as you have to have a keen
eye for detail when debugging lines of code.   

#### Creativity
- I come from a humanities background as well as accountancy and I can bring
creativity to problem solving, generating new ideas and coding more generally.  

#### Debugging / Problem solving
- At Statpro I was able to debug issues such as with the general ledger by
querying the sql database using sql server.  
- UAT leading to the deployment of Sage Intacct.  Logging and debugging issues found during testing  

#### Communication
- Good communication was always required working in systems administration
so that any system issues, key information or warnings were clearly explained to users
and any training given was understood.  

#### Process Driven
- In all my roles as a systems admin writing and following procedures were
required for example ensuring new starters and leavers were processed according 
to the procedures for maintaining and removing users' system access.

#### Documentation writing
- I wrote the documentation for the purchase order system for system users at ETF in 2020.  
At Statpro I wrote documentation for multiple areas of the new deployed finance system (Sage Intacct) 
in 2019-2020.
