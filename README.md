## Personal Profile
I am a recent Makers Academy graduate looking for my first opportunity in software development.  I have a previous career in finance systems administration and I wanted to take the skills Iâ€™ve learned to the next level, working in a more dynamic sector with the opportunity to learn and solve interesting problems with diverse teams of people.  I am keen to develop what I learned at Makers Academy and have been contributing to open source projects such as the Adobe CLI Runtime on Github while I search for my first role.

## Skills
#### Problem Solving
- Resolving systems issues was a daily activity as finance systems support at Southern Housing, Statpro and ETF.  In each company I provided first line support for the finance system to the finance team.  At Statpro and Southern Housing this was managed via the Jira and Vivantio helpdesks respectively.  I picked up issues from those heldesks and resolved them through research, collaboration with the finance teams or if required the third party software support.  As a result I became adept at solving problems and I was able to utilise this skill during the Makers course and when working on personal coding projects to debug issues with code or when running tests.  

#### Attention to detail
- For example where Historical GL data was required for the deployment of a new finance system.  My task was to map the historical GL data to the new chart of accounts and upload the data for all entities prior to system deployment.  My action was to export historical GL data from the old finance system for prior years, to convert the coding of the data to the new chart of accounts and to convert the data into the correct template format for the upload, review data and ensure accuracy and then upload the data separately for each entity.  The result was that the data was uploaded for multiple entities in time for the deployment of the finance system.

#### Communication
- Good communication was always required working in systems administration for example when training.  An example of this was training requisitioners and approvers to use the purchase order system.  The task was to write the guidance documentation for the PO system and deliver training to budget holders and requisitioners.  My action was to deliver the training over multiple sessions, create the required Powerpoint slides, write the guidance documentation and ensure training examples were set up in the test system.  The result was that the guidance documentation was clear and ensured the users understood the company policies relating to purchase orders.  Positive feedback was received for the training and guidance documentation.  Users increased knowledge of the finance system and had recorded training as well as documentation to refer to.

#### Process Driven
- An example of this was the processing of finance systems helpdesk tickets.  The task was to ensure tickets were raised and processed correctly.  My action was to ensure that tickets were raised for finance systems issues, tickets had the relevant priority and detail, ensure that manager approval for the relevant tasks was received before actioning system changes such as opening and closing financial periods or creating GL codes.  The result was that the ticketing system was ewll maintained and system changes were made in accordance with procedure, ensuring a detailed audit trail for tickets so that analsis could take place based on helpdesk  reports.
